# Bring It Together: Classroom Builder Application

You've practiced your new skills with Arrays, Objects, Constructors, and Loops. Now it's time to put them all together!

With the business problem presented in this assignment, we will be a little closer to what it feels like to be in class or on the job as a developer. This type of problem will feel tough, so take your time with the problem and stretch what you know about JavaScript. Experiment as you work through the problem, we encourage you to rush to failure. Let us know where you get stuck because, as always, we are here to help.

## Prime Seating App

You will be building an application that creates and assigns seating for each of Prime's classrooms.

Extend the code in *bringItTogether.js* inside your *assignments* folder. Consider using some of the code you wrote in earlier assignments from this week as they will contain useful functionality.

## Instructions

Look at the code. You have been given an array of arrays. Each inner array describes a classroom:

* In the first position (or index) is the **total number of seats** needed.
* The second index represents how many **rolling office chairs** the room needs.
* Third is the **number of foam cubes** the room requires.
* Last is the **color** of fabric the seats should have.

## Output

Your job is to transform this starting data into *objects* and `console.log` the object out, one for each classroom. Each of these new objects will contain a number of properties:

* `capacity`: number of seats in the room
* `rollingChairs`: an array of objects describing a rolling office chair. See **Object Types** below for details about these chair objects.
* `cubes`: an array of objects describing a foam cube. See **Object Types** below for details about these cube objects.

Something like this:

```
var room = {
  capacity: 20,
  rollingChairs: [
    {RollingChair object}, {RollingChar object}, ...
  ],
  cubes: [
    {Cube object}, {Cube object}, ...
  ]
};
```

### Object Types

##### `RollingChair` objects have two properties:
  1. `color`: a String of the color of the chair fabric.
  2. `type`: a String of the type "rolling".

##### `Cube` objects have two properties:
  1. `length`: a Number representing the inches of each side of the cube. Assume the length of the cube is 24 units.
  2. `volume`: a method that returns the physical volume of the cube, which is the length to the power of three. You might consider using [`Math.pow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow) or just multiply the length by itself three times.


## Where To Start

Loop through the array of rooms and for each room array, convert the information into an object with various pieces of data inside it. Use the constructors provided to create your chair, cube, and room objects.

You will notice that these constructors are documented with a special comment syntax called a `docstring`. It looks like this:

```
/**
 * Represents a classroom at Prime
 * @constructor
 * @param {Array} array - a single room array of data
**/
```

Don't worry about this too much. First thing to know is that it is a comment block, meaning that it is not executable code. Next, you will see the description of what the constructor does. Finally, you will see a list of parameters, what they represent, and their types. Use this as additional information to help you understand what code you need to write.
